description: 'While a doctoral student at Princeton University in 1957, studying under a founder of theoretical computer science, Raymond Smullyan would occasionally visit New York City. On one of these visits, he met a "very charming lady musician" and, on their first date, Smullyan, an incorrigible flirt, proceeded very logically-and sneakily.'
