description: "Few things remind me of how much beauty there is in the world as clearly and reliably as Maira Kalman's work. An author, artist and designer, Kalman has written and illustrated dozens of books for children and adults, including The Principles of Uncertainty I visited Kalman at her incredible apartment in New York City, itself a kind of mini-museum."
